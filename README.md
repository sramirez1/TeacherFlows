# TeacherFlows

This project is intended to result in a "flow", "parallel sets", "sankey", or other data visualization that is interactive, rich with data, highly usable, and aesthetically well-designed. The purpose of the product is to facilitate better, more efficient, and more insightful examination of NYCDOE's teacher population over time. Some qualities of the ideal product are:

*  *live*: the product can be accessed via a browser
*  *timely*: the product is connected to more or less live data sources that minimize the need for manual data loads
*  *automated*: the majority of the data and programming is such that little to no manual conditioning is needed before the user begins to interact with the product. In other words, the product is already poised for interaction at any given point in time. 
*  *usable*: the product can be easily manipulated by the user along multiple dimensions/criteria
*  *useful*: the product serves a tangible business need. At present, it is theorized that the product can fulfill a broad range of data requests and analyses, including:
  + cross-sectional analyses (e.g. point-in-time frequencies) of teachers that meet various criteria;
  + longitudinal analyses of teachers according to various criteria (e.g. teacher preparation program analyses)

The first prototype of the visualization will be implemented using a Shiny Dashboard and a sankey visualization. Based on design critiques, user testing, and leadership input, subsequent prototypes may take advantage of more flexible platforms (i.e. d3.js).
